# RichPython

The intended goal of Rich Python is to read data from CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, represent them in a model and allow the user to display, alter, add, or remove records from the CSV file.

Utilizes the Rich Framework (https://pypi.org/project/rich/) for console output.

Originally a project for Algonquin College, this is archived here in the hopes that this may help future learners in understanding Python basics.
